# Rational-Link - Oracle Job Specifications and Example

Welcome to this educational repository.  
Here you’ll find example smart contracts and oracle job specifications that demonstrate how to connect on-chain applications with trusted off-chain data sources.

Our mission at [Rational-Link](https://www.rational-link.com) is to deliver **enterprise-grade oracle services** with reliability, uptime, and security at the core. The examples provided are to give developers the essential information needed to connect their Web3 apps to the Oracle services.

## Overview
- Example Solidity contracts for requesting and consuming external data.
- Sample TOML job descriptions to illustrate oracle job configuration.
- References to oracle contract addresses and job IDs for supported test networks.

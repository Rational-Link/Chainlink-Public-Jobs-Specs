# Rational-Link Oracle Examples

Welcome to the **Rational-Link educational repository**.  
Here you’ll find example smart contracts and oracle job specifications that demonstrate how to connect on-chain applications with trusted off-chain data sources.

Our mission at [Rational-Link](https://www.rational-link.com) is to deliver **enterprise-grade oracle services** with reliability, uptime, and security at the core. These examples are provided to help developers understand the fundamentals of oracle integration.

---

## Overview
- Example Solidity contracts for requesting and consuming external data.
- Sample TOML job descriptions to illustrate oracle job configuration.
- References to oracle contract addresses and job IDs for supported test networks.
- Designed for **learning and experimentation only** — not production use.

---

## Repository Structure
- `contracts/` → Solidity examples (educational only).
- `jobs/` → TOML job description samples.
- `docs/` → Additional notes and references.

---

## Oracle Details
- **Supported Networks**: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum (with more to come).  
- **Oracle Contract IDs & Job IDs**: Provided in examples for testnet usage.  
- **Fees**: Demonstrated with placeholder values for clarity.  

*(Always confirm the latest oracle addresses and job IDs with Rational-Link before deploying.)*

## Disclaimer
- All code and configurations are **for educational purposes only**.  
- Contracts use **hardcoded values** and **unaudited code**.  
- Do **not** deploy to production or use with real funds.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the Solidity contracts in [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or your preferred IDE.  
3. Update input parameters (API endpoint, JSON path, etc.) before compiling.  
4. Deploy to a testnet and connect with the provided oracle/job IDs.
